                <p>Framed by the soaring Central Highlands, Udawalawe is one of the best places in the world to see wild
                    elephants. Herds are often seen roaming in numbers of up to 100, with other mammals in the park
                    including water buffalo, wild boar, sloth bears, spotted deer and the endemic toque macaque. The
                    Park is home to a population of over 400 elephants and the probability of seeing them while on
                    safari is almost always guaranteed.</p><br>
                <p>The Walawe Reservoir is also encompassed within the Park, spanning over 3,000 hectares; it's a
                    favourite elephant hangout during times of water scarcity. Over 180 species of birds, the mugger
                    crocodile and sightings of more reptilian, plant life and other mammals too, are abundant spectacles
                    at the Park. Udawalawa can be accessed through the city of Ratnapura following the
                    Pellmadula-Embilipitiya Road and the Park can be visited throughout the year.</p><br>

                <p>Minneriya National Park, situated in Sri Lanka's cultural triangle, is a biodiversity hotspot and a
                    haven for wildlife enthusiasts. Renowned for hosting the "Gathering," one of the world's largest
                    gatherings of Asian elephants. As part of Sri Lanka's elephant corridor, large numbers of elephants
                    migrate across the country to Minneriya every year. This is believed to be the highest number of
                    elephants in one place.</p><br>
                <p>With just over 30 square miles, Minneriya National Park is a thrill-packed alternative to the more
                    vast expanses of other wildlife sanctuaries. Made of grasslands, thick scrub, and the wildlife that
                    roam their particular territory, the Park is fed by its giant reservoir which is also its
                    life-blood. A diversity of animals roams within the vicinity of the reservoir, as food and water
                    grow
                    scarce elsewhere in the Park. </p><br>

                <p>Known for its incredible spectacles of migratory birds, Bundala National Park is a great friend to
                    bird enthusiasts from the world over. Almost 200 bird species have been recorded here, including
                    ibis, pelicans and huge flocks of greater flamingos. Visitors can also spot crocodiles, elephants,
                    turtles and a variety of other fauna. Home to scrub jungle, wetlands, lagoons, salt pans, sand dunes
                    and a long stretch of coast, Bundala National Park's terrain is blessed with many faces of landscape
                    in unison with unlimited yet protected fauna.</p><br>
                <p>While glimpses of elephants are not as common as the crocodiles (estuarine as well as saltwater),
                    much anticipated are sightings of deer, langurs, the tusky (not to mention a tad touchy) wild boar,
                    and even the spotted fishing cat. Although Bundala National Park is a fairly small area of
                    sanctuary, nearly 30 square miles, its diversity of species is rich and therefore can be a quick
                    safari trip if you want to make the most of the island's wilderness in a short space of time.</p>
