                <p class="anim_txt">Ranging over 131 thousand hectares, Wilpattu Sri Lanka's largest and one of the
                    oldest protected areas. The park spans across the Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts, and borders
                    the Mannar and Vavuniya Districts. The area is one of the most important places to observe the
                    elusive Sri Lankan leopard and the sloth bear.</p><br>
                <p class="anim_txt">This park has a denser forest cover unlike many other National Parks in Sri Lanka.
                    Wilpattu's landscape comprises of dry zone forests and thorny scrub interspersed with extensive open
                    plains, sand dunes and the unique Villu wetlands. Bare reddish cliffs rising abruptly from narrow
                    beaches of the Portugal Bay and Dutch Bay are another striking feature of its landscape.</p>

                <h2>History of Wilpaththu National Park</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>While Wilpattu was first designated a wildlife sanctuary as far back as 1905, it wasn't until
                    February 1938 that this 13,500-hectare park was elevated to national park status. Yet, its story
                    begins much earlier than this. The copper shoreline of the reserve, specifically at Kudiramalai, a
                    rocky promontory, is widely believed to have been the landing spot of the Indian Prince Vijaya in
                    the 5th century BC. The region's alternative name 'Thambapanni' came due to the reddish colour of
                    the sand that stained the hands and feet of Prince Vijaya and his 700-odd followers when they came
                    ashore. The ruins of Kuveni's palace is just one of 68 archeological sites within Wilpattu National
                    Park.</p>

                <h2>Guide to Wilpaththu...</h2><br>
                <p>The full extent of Wilpattu National Park is open to visitors, and this is eight times larger than
                    Yala National Park's Block I. You need a little more time to explore Wilpattu - reaching the main,
                    open areas of the reserve takes a good 45 minutes - though you can stay all day.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item1">
                <p>Wilpattu National Park, partly due to its more remote north westerly location, sees much less tourism
                    footfall than Yala which means that when you do sight a leopard, sloth bear or elephant, your jeep
                    is likely to be the only one watching it. You can take your time and maximise your enjoyment of the
                    Wilpattu safari experience.</p>
