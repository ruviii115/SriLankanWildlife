                <h2>Yala National Park</h2><br>
                <p>Yala combines a strict nature reserve with a national park. Divided into 5 blocks, the park has a
                    protected area of nearly 130,000 hectares of land consisting of light forests, scrubs, grasslands,
                    tanks and lagoons. Two blocks are currently opened to the public.</p><br>
                <p>Situated in Sri Lanka's south-east hugging the panoramic Indian Ocean, Yala was initially used as a
                    hunting ground for the elite under British rule. Yala is home to 44 varieties of mammal and 215 bird
                    species. Among its more famous residents are the world's biggest concentration of leopards, majestic
                    elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodiles. The best time to
                    visit Yala is between February and July when the water levels of the park are quite low, bringing
                    animals into the open.</p>

                <h2>History of Yala National Park</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Yala is one of Sri Lanka's oldest national parks and was designated a wildlife sanctuary as far back
                    as 1900 though it wasn't until 1938 that it was established as a national park. Right in the heart
                    of Yala sits the Buddhist temple Sithulpawa, and this former monastery is thought to date back 2,000
                    years. At one time, the monastery is thought to have housed 12,000 inhabitants, and today, it
                    remains an important temple visited by pilgrims across Sri Lanka. Other significant cultural sites
                    in the vicinity include Kataragama and Magul Maha Vihara.</p>

                <h2>Guide to Yala...</h2><br>
                <p>Yala comprises five blocks, and while most game drives take place in Block I, game drives can and do
                    occur in other blocks within the reserve. This is much more likely in September and October when
                    Block I is often closed to visitors for around six weeks to allow animals unrestricted freedom of
                    movement.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item1">
                <p>Chena Huts is very conveniently located near the main Palutapana entrance of Yala, and it
                    takes just minutes to reach the ticket desk from the hotel. Once inside, the network of tracks
                    within the reserve are extensive, and our drivers are experienced in seeking out some of the more
                    off-beat areas that avoid the crowds.</p>
